My two ideas for the deisgn studio were representing the uncertainty in different ways. 

The first idea included plotting an the row-average of the estimates, with colored dots representing the estimates in the background of the design. 
This design would also include a brush component (as in problem 3) that would modify both the x and y scales when focusing on an area of the graph to allow
better visual comprehension of the uncertainties.

The second idea was similar, but instead of dots, I calculated the row- min and row- max for each year. I stored this new data in consensus.csv.
I would represent the row min/max with error bars in a lighter shade than the average line to create foreground and background.

This is the idea I plan on implementing. I would include tool tips to highlight the average value and both the min/max and % difference of these estimates in 
order to give a comprehensive picture of the data and the uncertainty.




I worked on this for over 60 hours, and ultimately did not have time to complete the implementation as I ran into bugs that I was not able to address and
spent a lot of time trying to address.
